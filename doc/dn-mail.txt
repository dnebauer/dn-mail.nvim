Introduction                                                     *dn_mail.intro*

An auxiliary mail plugin providing:
• completion of email addresses in eml file address lines using
  a neomutt alias file
• re-flow text support
• folding of quoted text
• optional use of markdown syntax highlighting for the message body
  (mapping and command provided)
• sentence-based text objects (requires "vim-textobj-sentence" plugin)
• sensible formatting preferences
• optional re-wrapping of paragraphs (mapping provided).

Address completion is covered in its own section below
(|dn_mail.address_completion|) while other features are explained in the
sections on settings (|dn_mail.settings|), mappings (|dn_mail.mappings|)
and commands (|dn_mail.commands|).

==============================================================================
Address completion                                  *dn_mail.address_completion*

This feature assumes a single file is used to store all emails harvested
from the user's maildirs. The file stores one email address per line in
standard neomutt alias definitions, for example:
>
    alias johnno John Citizen <john@isp.com> # personal email
<
The default location of the aliases file is "~/.config/neomutt/aliases" but
this can be changed by the |dn_mail.dn_alias_file| global variable.

If no aliases file is available, unreadable, or provides no email
addresses in the expected format, address completion will abort with a
warning message.

The plugin hooks into vim's user defined completion in buffers with the
|filetype| "mail" or "notmuch-compose". Address lines are those beginning
with any of:
• From:
• To:
• Cc:
• Bcc:

On these lines the user can press |ctrl-x_ctrl-u| to activate address
completion.

This feature is based on a plugin by Aaron D. Borden at
https://github.com/adborden/vim-notmuch-address.

Settings                                                      *dn_mail.settings*

                                                            *dn_mail.alias_file*
                                                *dn_mail.variable_dn_alias_file*
Path to alias file ~

The global variable "dn_alias_file" contains the absolute path to a file
containing one email address per line in standard neomutt alias
definitions.

This plugin needs to access this file to provide address completion, so
it needs to be specified with the global variable "dn_alias_file" if it
is not located in the default location.

If there is no alias file address completion will abort with a warning
message.

Default: $HOME/.config/neomutt/aliases

                                                           *dn_mail.reflow_text*
                                                      *dn_mail.option_textwidth*
                                                  *dn_mail.option_formatoptions*
                                                       *dn_mail.option_comments*
Reflow text support ~

Support reflowing of content with the following option settings:
• 'textwidth' = 72
• 'formatoptions' += "q"
• 'comments' += "nb:>"

These settings assume the user's mail agent supports reflowing of text,
e.g., in neomutt the setting "text_flowed" is set to true.

                                                           *dn_mail.fold_quoted*
                                                       *dn_mail.option_foldexpr*
                                                     *dn_mail.option_foldmethod*
                                                      *dn_mail.option_foldlevel*
                                                   *dn_mail.option_foldminlines*
                                                    *dn_mail.option_colorcolumn*
Folding of quoted text ~

Support folding of quoted text with the following option settings:
• 'foldexpr' = "strlen(substitute(matchstr(
                getline(v:lnum),'\\v^\\s*%(\\>\\s*)+'),'\\s','','g'))"
• 'foldmethod' = "expr"
• 'foldlevel' = 1
• 'foldminlines' = 2
• 'colorcolumn' = "72"

These settings were taken from the "mutt-trim" github repo README file
(see https://github.com/Konfekt/mutt-trim).

                                           *dn_mail.sentence_based_text_objects*
Sentence-based text objects ~

Sentence-based text objects are more sensible for composing emails.
If the "preservim/vim-textobj-sentence" plugin is installed, that plugin's
behaviour is activated by running the "textobj#sentence#init" function.
See https://github.com/preservim/vim-textobj-sentence for more details.

                                                *dn_mail.formatting_preferences*
                                                     *dn_mail.option_formatexpr*
Formatting preferences ~

The 'formatexpr' option is set to "tqna1".

                                                              *dn_mail.autolist*
                                                          *dn_mail.mapping_<CR>*
Autolist ~

If the "gaoDean/autolist.nvim" plugin is installed, the |<Enter>| key is
remapped to trigger that plugin's ":AutolistNewBullet" command. The
effect of that command is that if the cursor is on a list entry, a new
list entry is automatically created on the following line.
See https://github.com/gaoDean/autolist.nvim for more details.
Note that this mapping may be overridden by other plugins mapping the
|<Enter>] key.

Mappings                                                      *dn_mail.mappings*

                                                 *dn_mail.markdown_highlighting*
                                                    *dn_mail.mapping_<Leader>md*
\md = markdown highlighting of message body ~

Use this mapping in |Normal-mode| and |Insert-mode| to change syntax
highlighting of the email message body to markdown. This is useful for
mail programs configured to process the message body to convert markdown
to html.

Be aware that there is no corresponding mapping or command to reverse
this change once applied.

<Alt-q> = rewrap paragraph ~

Use "Alt-q" in |Normal-mode| and |Insert-mode| to rewrap the current
paragraph as per |gq|.
